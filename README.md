# Week2Test

I have creaded three PostgreSQL query files for creating a table in the database, loading data from the txt file and obtaining the required output.

- The ***`CreateTable_Dividend.sql`*** file contains queries to creade a new empty table **`dividend`** in the database, containing two rows (company and fiscal_year).

- The ***`Data_Dividend.sql`*** file contains queries to load data from the ***test_data.txt*** into the `dividend` table.

- The ***`Query_ValueStocks.sql`*** file contains queries to obtain the required output of ValueStock companies from the given data.

NOTE : THE QUERY ***`Data_Dividend.sql`*** WILL BE SUCCESSFULLY EXECUTED ONLY IF THE FILE  ***`test_data.txt`*** IS PLACED IN THE `data` FOLDER OF THE `PostgreSQL` FOLDER (MOST PROBABLY LOCATED IN `C:\ProgramData\PostgreSQL\data`) OR IF THE ABSOLUTE PATH OF `test_data.txt` IS GIVEN IN THE ***`Data_Dividend.sql`*** file.
